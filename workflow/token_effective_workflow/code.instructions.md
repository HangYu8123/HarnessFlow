# Add New Functions to an Existing Repo

**Safety: follow `_lib/safety_rules.md`.**

> **Unified workflow (platform-adaptive).** This single file serves Claude Code, Codex, and VS Code Copilot. Resolve all paths via Pack Path Resolution (`.github/HarnessFlow/<path>` when installed, or `<path>` from the repo root). Launch subagents using your platform's mechanism per [`_lib/workflow_contract.md`](../../_lib/workflow_contract.md) §Subagent Invocation. Handle repo-context handoff per [`_lib/workflow_contract.md`](../../_lib/workflow_contract.md) §Context Passing for Subagents: on **Claude Code** the main agent builds a condensed **[repo context digest]** and passes it inline to subagents; on **Codex** and **VS Code Copilot**, subagents read **[key md files]** directly.

<!-- Required Context Files (CLI-resolvable paths):

[inputs]:
- input 1: [target functionalities]
- input 2: [important files] (optional)
- input 3: [target repo] (optional, default to current repo)

[key md files]: codebase_overview.md, scripts_overview.md, update_logs.md, known_issues.md (under `repo_info/`, resolved via Pack Path Resolution). In multi-layer repos, also read the `codebase_overview.md` + `scripts_overview.md` of each discovered layer per `_lib/workflow_contract.md` §Key Context Files → Multi-Layer / Nested Repos.

**read through this entire file and follow the instructions carefully**.
Before doing any workflow-specific work, the main agent must read and follow [`_lib/workflow_contract.md`](../../_lib/workflow_contract.md) and [`philosophy/philosophy.instructions.md`](../../philosophy/philosophy.instructions.md) before proceeding.
Every subagent created by this workflow must instead read and follow [`_lib/subagent_contract.md`](../../_lib/subagent_contract.md) and [`philosophy/philosophy.instructions.md`](../../philosophy/philosophy.instructions.md) before reading [key md files] or performing task-specific work.

Subagent launch rule: Follow the Subagent Launch Contract in [`_lib/workflow_contract.md`](../../_lib/workflow_contract.md). **Every spawn carries two dials, not one:** model from the `subagent_model` header, effort from the `subagent_effort` header (and from `online_researcher_effort` for the Online Researcher). Unless the resolved effort is `inherit`, set the platform effort field where the spawn exposes one, otherwise put the line `effort: <level> — binding budget, not a hint` in the subagent prompt. After each subagent returns, the main agent must check that the result is complete, task-specific, grounded in the requested files, and uses the expected output label.

> **Subagent invocation:** See `_lib/workflow_contract.md` §Subagent Invocation.

## CREATE ONE TODO PER STEP

### Step 1 - Context Gathering
Read [key md files]. If important files are specified in [inputs], read them. Condense them (plus any target files) into a **[repo context digest]** for use in later steps, and hand off repo context to subagents per [`_lib/workflow_contract.md`](../../_lib/workflow_contract.md) §Context Passing for Subagents: on **Claude Code** the main agent passes [repo context digest] inline; on **Codex** and **VS Code Copilot** subagents read [key md files] directly.

**Local Skill Discovery (before any plan drafting):** Perform Local Skill Discovery per `_lib/local_skill_discovery.md` — scan `skills/index.md` for any local skill whose trigger fits [inputs]/the task; on a confirmed match, read its `SKILL.md`. Keep the result as [local skills], fold it into the repo context (per §Context Passing) so the Step 3 subagents receive it, and integrate it when the main agent drafts [plan]/[final plan]. If nothing matches, record [local skills]: none relevant.

### Step 2 - Implementation Planning
Based on the repo context (per §Context Passing) + [inputs], the main agent reads the relevant files and proposes a [plan] for integrating the target functionalities (files to add/change, integration points, dependencies) + notes on keeping existing behavior and tests stable.

**Role emulation** (see [`_lib/workflow_contract.md`](../../_lib/workflow_contract.md) §Main-Agent Role Emulation): read `agents/focus-analyst.agent.md`, `agents/broad-analyst.agent.md`, `agents/free-analyst.agent.md`, and `agents/senior-engineer.agent.md` (plan review), and apply each as a lens on the files read in this step — depth on the most directly relevant files, the pipeline upstream→downstream, free-judgment reading, and a senior-engineer pass on correctness, feasibility, and regressions — into [plan].

### Step 3 - Plan Challenge and Research
**[PARALLEL EXECUTION — launch all listed subagents in parallel; see [`_lib/workflow_contract.md`](../../_lib/workflow_contract.md) §Parallel Execution & Fallback]**

| Subagent | Agent | When to spawn | Task |
|----------|-------|---------------|------|
| Challenge | **Devils Advocate** (`agents/devils-advocate.agent.md`) | Always | Read the repo context (per §Context Passing) + [plan] + [inputs], and additional files/scripts if needed. Assume every step in the [plan] is wrong, flawed, and over-engineered; identify overlooked side effects, integration risks, incorrect assumptions, over-engineering and regressions. Then explain why the items are wrong, flawed, and over-engineered. Distinguish genuine defects from out-of-scope or speculative additions, and report only evidence-backed criticisms (do not manufacture problems). Return [challenge report]. |
| Research | **Online Researcher** (`agents/online-researcher.agent.md`) | Always | Read the repo context (per §Context Passing) + [plan] + [inputs]. Search online for reliable references, established solutions, and available resources. Return [online resource]. |

### Step 4 - Refine and Approval Gate
The main agent incorporates [challenge report] and [online resource] (when produced) into a [final plan]. Print [final plan].

**Approval gate (opt-in):** see `_lib/approval_gate.md` — proceed directly to Step 5 unless the user asked for no code/file changes or a plan-only review.

### Step 5 - Implementation
The main agent implements [final plan] directly and records [implementation report] containing changes only, with no explanations.

### Step 6 - Code Review and Validation
1. **Review skills (opt-in; both headers default to `false`):** resolve the request's `simplify` and `code_review` headers per [`_lib/review_skills.md`](../../_lib/review_skills.md) — `false` skips, `true` runs Claude Code's native `/simplify` / `/code-review medium`, `local` runs the pack's local `code-simplification` / `code-review-and-quality` skills (portable to every platform). Spawn one subagent per enabled skill, **sequentially, simplify first**, following the Subagent Launch Contract in [`_lib/workflow_contract.md`](../../_lib/workflow_contract.md) (subagents use the `subagent_model` header; keep an activity log and record fallbacks). Pass each the changed files (the current diff) + [final plan] + [implementation report] plus the relevant repo context. Record [simplify] and/or [code-review] for whichever ran; leave a skipped skill's label unproduced.
2. The main agent reviews the changes directly, validates the implementation with [final plan] + [implementation report], and reports the conclusion as [direct review].

Based on whichever of [simplify] + [code-review] + [direct review] were produced, the main agent analyzes and validates them all, and generates a [final report]. Then the main agent applies the clearly-correct, low-risk findings (do not auto-apply uncertain or behavior-changing ones), then records any remaining gaps for Step 7.

### Step 7 - Documentation and Summary
1. Update codebase_overview.md and scripts_overview.md based on actual changes and [final report].
2. Write to update_logs.md:
```md
{=============================Function Update===============================}
{Functionality Name + Timestamp (current time, YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM) + ID (last ID + 1)}
{Description (1-2 sentences)}
{Repos involved}
{Request (what was requested)}
{Implementation (what was changed)}
{Achieved (yes/no, gaps if any)}
```
3. Summarize changes in bullet points to chat, and a yes/no answer indicating whether the functionalities have been updated with no issues. If there are gaps, describe them.
